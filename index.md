### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs since our program was implemented into a realistic situation, that is parking availability. The user
    identifies the time, day, and street, which is then passed to the program to check whether parking is allowed or not. I learned how to use if,
    else, and else if statements to check the conditions for a street's parking availability. The program would then assign true to the boolean
    variable if the conditions were met, and false, if the conditions weren't met. Finally, the program would print if parking was allowed or not
    with the given conditions.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favortie labs since I could see this being really useful and convenient in a science class like Chemistry, where
    the unit of measurement has to be specific and accurate. I learned how to assign the value of a variable to the return value of a call to a 
    function with a parameter. Each function would take the parameter, mililiters, which was initially stored from the prompt to the user to then
    return the value of the converted unit of measurement. The return value of that function call would then be assigned to another variable, where
    it would then be printed out with the units.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite labs since I've always played Blackjack even since I was a child, and it was interesting to see how the game
    could be replicated into a program. I learned how to write and call boolean functions to check certain conditions, and if those conditions were
    to not be met, would return false and end the program. For instance, if there weren't 3 arguments, and 2 of those arguments being cards, passed to 
    the program, then it would end. We also used boolean expressions to identify whether a card was a face card, number card, or an ace. Then, the program would call the function TwoCardHandScore, which would first call another function to assign the value of the card to the card, and then add those
    values to get the total value of the hand.
